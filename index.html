       				<h2>Prerequisite: ECE323</h2>
					<h3>Course Description</h3>
					<p>
					    The internal structure and operation of microcontrollers will be studied.
                        The design methodology for software and hardware applications will be developed 
                        through the labs and design projects.
					</p>
                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>The objective of this course is to engage students in designing and implementing 
                        electronic devices using combinations of software, programmable microcontroller 
                        and various electronics components. Techniques for data exchange between embedded 
                        system and desktop computer will be explored. Embedded system for sensor applications 
                        will be introduced. Desktop application using Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
                        will be introduced in C# programming language.
                    </p>
                    <p>This course emphasizes learning through hands-on experiments. There are extensive lab 
                        exercise and projects. Students are expected to develop independence and learn much 
                        of the material on their own. Instructor and TAs play the roles of facilitators to 
                        guide you for discovering your full potential and developing your problem solving 
                        and troubleshooting skills.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
                    <p>
                        Upon completion of this course, students will understand the architecture of the 
                        PIC microcontrollers, gain experience in designing and implementing both hardware 
                        and software aspects of an embedded system; in firmware development using ANSI C 
                        and in graphical user interface desktop application development using C# programming language.

                    <h3>Labs and projects</h3>
                    <p>There are about 11 hands-on labs and one final project. Most labs weight from 5 to 50 points each. Final project weight 100 points.</p>
                    <ol>
